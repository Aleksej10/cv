# CV template 

Simple cirriculum vitae **html/css** template. 

## Hacking

All dimensions are in fixed proportions to the paper size so they are easy to modify without 
having to think about making the page look funny. There are also several easy to use css classes.
Dimensions used are globaly defined, so you only have to change them in one place, if you need to.
The dimensions are dynamic, and most of them use `vmin` as an unit, and the page itself is 
dynamically shown depending on viewing mode (prortrait/landscape - mobile/desktop).

## Printing

Main element has A4 paper proportions, so the page is easy to save as pdf in the same format.
Shadow effects and margin sizes are grouped together, commenting them out will give you ready to print page (I suppose you don't want shadows printed).

## Tip for Mozilla Firefox users

If you use frefox, make sure you disable margins when saving the page as pdf.
Also, for some reason saving the page with 150% zoom gives the actuall 100% size, but that might just be a bug in firefox version I'm using.
